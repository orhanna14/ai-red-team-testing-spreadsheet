# Red Team Testing Spreadsheet Generator

This Python script generates a structured Excel spreadsheet for red team testing of AI models. The spreadsheet includes multiple sheets for organizing test cases, model information, test results, vulnerability assessments, and more. It is designed to help teams systematically evaluate the robustness and security of AI models.

## Features

- **Multiple Sheets**: Includes sheets for test case inventory, model information, test results, comparative analysis, hypothesis testing, vulnerability assessment, attack pattern library, and project timeline.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the script to add or remove columns, rows, or sheets.
- **Automated**: Generates a fully formatted Excel file with a single command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `openpyxl`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-team-testing-spreadsheet.git
   cd red-team-testing-spreadsheet
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python create_spreadsheet.py
   ```

3. The script will generate an Excel file named `Red_Team_Testing_Spreadsheet.xlsx` in the same directory.

### File Structure

- **`create_spreadsheet.py`**: The main script that generates the Excel file.
- **`Red_Team_Testing_Spreadsheet.xlsx`**: The output Excel file (generated after running the script).
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

### Spreadsheet Structure

The generated Excel file contains the following sheets:

1. **Test Case Inventory**: Lists all test cases with details like attack type, target behavior, and success criteria.
2. **Model Information**: Provides details about the models being tested.
3. **Test Results**: Records the results of each test for a specific model (one sheet per model).
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compares the performance of different models for each test.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Documents hypotheses and their validation.
6. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifies and assesses vulnerabilities in the models.
7. **Attack Pattern Library**: Catalogs attack patterns and their effectiveness.
8. **Project Timeline & Progress**: Tracks the progress of the red team testing project.

### Customization

- Add or remove rows/columns in the script to suit your needs.
- Modify the sheet names or structure by editing the `pd.DataFrame` objects in the script.
- Add additional sheets by creating new DataFrames and writing them to the Excel file.
